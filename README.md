# Apache CXF Circuit Breaker

Scenario: Cascade service outage.

Solution: Fail fast, gracefully. Resume services, cautiously. Use a
circuit breaker.

# Circuit Breaker Pattern

The key concepts of the circuit breaker is that one places service
access under a management component, this component monitors the
service.

## CLOSED STATE

When all is well, the circuit breaker operates in CLOSED state - that is
to say requests are routed to their service provider.

## OPENED STATE

When requests to the service begin to fail, repeatedly the component at
some configured threshold will OPEN the circuit, halting the flow of
requests to the service (which reduces load on that serviceâ€™s host) and
immediately returns an error response (no need to timeout a request
thread, reducing caller resource usage).

## HALF-OPEN STATE

When the circuit breaker is half-open, it will allow a small number of
requests to proceed to the service - it monitors for their success. If
the calls succeed, it may fully close the circuit to resume regular
operation, otherwise it will re-open the circuit.
