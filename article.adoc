== Apache CXF Circuit Breaker

Scenario: Cascade service outage.

Solution: Fail fast, gracefully. Resume services, cautiously. Use a circuit breaker.

== Circuit Breaker Pattern

The key concepts of the circuit breaker is that one places service access under a management component. The circuit breaker then acts as a traffic officer, preventing a down stream service from getting calls it can not serve, while also immediately failing client calls as to not make them await results. This behavoir in a small scale application may appear to be over-kill, in larger systems this may act to prevent cascading failures.

In the above diagram the circuit breaker, when opened, prevents other services from potentially failing due resource exhaustion on the service side processing timeout requests from the client application seeking the data service.

=== CLOSED STATE

When all is well, the circuit breaker operates in CLOSED state - that is to say requests are routed to their service provider.


=== OPENED STATE

When requests to the service begin to fail, repeatedly the component at some configured threshold will OPEN the circuit, halting the flow of requests to the service (which reduces load on that service's host) and immediately returns an error response (no need to timeout a request thread, reducing caller resource usage).

=== HALF-OPEN STATE

When the circuit breaker is half-open, it will allow a small number of requests to proceed to the service - it monitors for their success. If the calls succeed, it may fully close the circuit to resume regular operation, otherwise it will re-open the circuit.
